## ✅ Tasks Completed

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion ✅
**Objective**: Compare manual vs AI-generated code implementations

**What Was Done**:
- Created Python function to sort list of dictionaries by key
- Manual implementation vs AI-generated alternative
- Performance benchmarking (1000 iterations)
- Efficiency analysis

**Key Findings**:
- Manual Implementation: 2.7 seconds (1000 iterations)
- AI Implementation: 4.2 seconds (1000 iterations)
- **Manual version is 37% faster**

   - User successfully logged in and redirected to success page

2. ✅ **Invalid Password** - Test with incorrect password
   - Result: PASSED ✓
   - System correctly rejected invalid credentials with error message

3. ✅ **Empty Fields** - Test form submission without input
   - Result: PASSED ✓
   - Form validation working correctly

**Overall Results**: **3/3 tests passed (100% success rate)** ✅

**Framework Used**:

**How AI Improves Testing vs Manual Approach**:

| Aspect | Manual Testing | Automated Testing |
|--------|---|---|
| **Speed** | 10+ minutes for 3 scenarios | 30 seconds |
| **Consistency** | Subject to human error | Identical execution every time |
| **Scalability** | Impractical for 100+ tests | Scales effortlessly |
| **Regression Detection** | Easy to miss regressions | Instantly catches breaks |
| **24/7 Execution** | Limited to business hours | Runs continuously |
| **Cost** | Requires QA team time | One-time setup, continuous reuse |

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation 🔄
**Objective**: Train ML model to predict issue priority using Breast Cancer dataset

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**What Will Be Done**:
- Load and preprocess Breast Cancer dataset
- Split data (80/20 train/test)
- Normalize features with StandardScaler
- Train Random Forest Classifier (100 estimators, max_depth=10)
- Evaluate using Accuracy and F1-Score
- Generate visualizations (confusion matrix, feature importance)

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Jupyter Notebook with full ML pipeline
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)
- Feature importance visualization
- Model insights and recommendations

**Technologies**:
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split)
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualizations)
- NumPy (numerical operations)

## 🧠 Theoretical Analysis

### Q1: Limitations of AI in Software Engineering
- AI tools occasionally generate incorrect or suboptimal code
- Context where AI struggles (domain-specific logic)
- Hallucination problem in code generation
- When human oversight is irreplaceable

### Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning for Bug Detection

| Aspect | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |
|--------|---|---|
| **Data Requirements** | Labeled dataset | Unlabeled data |
| **Bug Detection Use** | Historical bug patterns | Anomaly detection |
| **Example** | Training on past bugs | Clustering unusual patterns |
| **Accuracy** | Higher (with quality labels) | Discovers unknown bugs |

### Q3: Bias Mitigation in User Experience Personalization
- Biased training data leads to unfair recommendations
- Underrepresented groups receive poor UX
- Real-world consequences of algorithmic discrimination
- Mitigation: Data auditing, fairness constraints, diverse review

### Case Study: AIOps
**How AIOps Improves Deployment Efficiency**:

1. **Predictive Failure Detection**: AI predicts deployment failures before they happen (87% accuracy), preventing production incidents
2. **Intelligent Rollback**: Automatic rollback triggered within seconds when anomalies detected, reducing downtime from hours to seconds
